# Operator Panel

This project contains code for an operator user interface which can run many tests in parallel.

It is implemented as a panel for Keysight Test Automation (KS8400).

Note that to use it as a panel plugin for Keysight Test Automation a TAP_Engine license is required.

Releases can be downloaded from the OpenTAP package repository at https://packages.opentap.io.

You can use the source code in this project for the basis for your own operator UI, use it as documentation, or contribute your own changes if you think they should be available to the greater community.
