The operator panel is a panel for the Test Automation Shell to run manufacturing tests in a streamlined and efficient way.

All panels run the same test plan, but each has a separate set of external parameters that are set individually.

When used in 'focus mode', there are no way of modifying or affecting the test plan run, except from in few intended ways. 

The operator panel is provided as a plugin, but since panels are an often asked about feature, the source code is provided as a basis for or example of a new panel implementation. 

It can also be used as-is.

The source code is provided under the MIT license.
